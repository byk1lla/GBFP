Hi Im Ismail,
Today I will show you how to use GBFP.
First open an emulator to run Python.(If you are using Linux, use Pycharm.)
(If you're on Windows, I can recommend Sublime Text or Python's own emulator.)
Second, Copy and Paste the Code into the Emulator.
Enter your own email address in the myMailAdress variable.
Likewise, enter your password in the password variable.
Third and finally,
Enclose the things you want to write in the Subject and Message values.
(for example: subject="love"
message = "I love you so much <3")
Do not touch the content variable and other codes, the program will run without problems.
Thank You.
